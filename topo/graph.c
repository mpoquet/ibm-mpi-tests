 These test cases reflect an interpretation of the MPI Standard.  They are
 are, in most cases, unit tests of specific MPI behaviors.  If a user of any
 test case from this set believes that the MPI Standard requires behavior
 different than that implied by the test case we would appreciate feedback.
